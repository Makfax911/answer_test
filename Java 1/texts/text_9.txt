Second, Java’s designers did not “reinvent the wheel.” Instead, they further refined an already highly successful programming paradigm. The modern age of programming began with C. It moved to C++, and now to Java. By inheriting and building upon that rich heritage, Java provides a powerful, logically consistent programming environment that takes the best of the past and adds new features required by the online environment. Perhaps most important, because of their similarities, C, C++, and Java define a common, conceptual framework for the professional programmer. Programmers do not face major rifts when switching from one language to another.
