One of the central design philosophies of both C and C++ is that the programmer is in charge! Java also inherits this philosophy. Except for those constraints imposed by the Internet environment, Java gives you, the programmer, full control. If you program well, your programs reflect it. If you program poorly, your programs reflect that, too. Put differently, Java is not a language with training wheels. It is a language for professional programmers.
