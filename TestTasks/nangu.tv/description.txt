Test task from nangu.tv

We are sending you a light assignment within the tender, which will be part of the technical part of the interview. What frameworks/libraries you choose is not essential, but the choice of technology and their suitability will be part of INTV (we use Java 8+/Kotlin, access to database, messaging, elasticsearch, ...).

Create a simple application that will keep messages from different authors. Save the result on your gitlab and send us a link.

Functional requirements:
• application will allow to save (edit?, delete?) the message
    ◦ ? allow editing and delete messages only to the author
• application will allow you to view messages
    ◦ messages possible to display as list
    ◦ messages possible to filter by author
    ◦ ? possible to search messages by text

Implementation:

Bonus interview question: How to prepare/edit the application for running in several independent locations at the same time?
It is not necessary to do everything, but the interview will be conducted on a topic similar to the application entry.
