Modify the query to select only the products having a price equal to or greater than 100. Results should be ordered by price in descending order.

Throughout the test, the SQL syntax to be used is the ANSI syntax. For example:

    for inner joins use the "INNER JOIN ... ON ..." keywords and not the specific MySQL "USING" syntax
    for outer joins, use the "LEFT OUTER JOIN" keywords and not the specific Oracle "a=b(*)" syntax or Sybase "a *= b" syntax

Output exactly the PRODUCT_ID, NAME and PRICE columns as in the example below.
 
Example of output:

---------------------------------------------
| PRODUCT_ID | NAME                | PRICE  |
---------------------------------------------
| 14         | ProForm 6.0 RT      | 499.99 |
| 12         | GreenWorks 25022    | 172.73 |
| 0          | Kindle Fire 7       | 119.00 |
| 15         | Weider 190 RX       | 100.90 |
---------------------------------------------

Solution:

SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM product WHERE price >=100 ORDER BY price DESC
