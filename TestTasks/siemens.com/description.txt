JAVA Test

SIEMENS INDUSTRY SOFTWARE s.r.o.
Please, prepare the solution in object oriented programming and overall patterns.
Here are two questions for homework… candidates should have 3-4 hours to complete it and send it back. It should be done in Java.
Here are two tasks:
Common requirements for implementation:  1) implementation should be with good memory and calculation complexity2) we expect OOP design
3) Unit tests (preferable JUnit)

Question 1:
You are given input in 2 dimensional array (for example)
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
and you are asked to provide output in one dimensional array, fallowing outside-towards-inside pattern (snail). In this case output would be 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5.
Code should work for n*m combination of 2 dimensional array and always fallow outside edges towards inside.
Another example:
input:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 a b c
output should be: 1,2,3,4,8,c,b,a,9,5,6,7
Question 2: (square array rotation by 90 degrees)
input
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
n by n array that needs to produce fallowing output
3 6 9
2 5 8
1 4 7
Bonus is Unit tests for both questions.
Thank you.
